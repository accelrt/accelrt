### Scrapyard Sydney

Scrapyard Sydney **[hyperlink required]** was an energetic, beginner-friendly hackathon held in Sydney, Australia in March 2025, running simultaneously with other Scrapyard events glbally, specifically for participants under 18. Over two days, participants built games, apps, websites, or even hardware, tasked to solve a problem with the most absurd and creative solution. The event promoted learning and having fun, with workshops to help beginners get started. There were silly prizes for the most inventive creations, and the weekend saw **[how many people?]** students come together to ship ðŸš€.
