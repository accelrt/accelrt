## Currently Planning â€” Submerged

AccelRT's upcoming 36-hour hackathon designed for high school students to dive into a world transformed by rising sea levels, where creativity and STEM skills are put to the test. Set in Sydney, this event challenges teams to invent bold, unconventional solutions â€” software or hardware â€” that help people thrive in a future where much of civilization is underwater. Participants will collaborate, attend hands-on workshops, and receive mentorship from experienced university students, all while building real prototypes and forming lasting friendships.

There were silly prizes for the most inventive creations, and the weekend saw **~120** students come together to ship ðŸš€.

### Counterspell

Counterspell Sydney was a high-energy, student-led game jam in November 2024 where teams of high school students came together to design and build original games from scratch. The event provided a creative, collaborative space filled with workshops, mentorship, and hands-on learning opportunities. Participants tackled a surprise theme, rapidly prototyped their ideas, and showcased their finished games to a supportive community. The event celebrated creativity, teamwork, and technical skill, leaving everyone with new friends, practical experience, and a sense of accomplishment.
